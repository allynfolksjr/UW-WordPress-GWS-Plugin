# Authentication and Restriction plugin for WordPress

This plugin is designed to provide a number of desired features to our WordPress instance. 

## Current features include:


## Planned Improvements Include:

* Ability to restrict entire site to particular NetIDs
* Ability to restrict specified pages to particular NetIDs
* Ability to restrict specific posts to particular NetIDs
* Ability to restrict specific categories to particular NetIDs
* Ability to use UW Groups service to set restrictions instead of specififying specific NetIDs

## What this plugin doesn't do:

* Restrict media content. If a user knows the direct URL to media, they can access it without needing to
authenticate.
