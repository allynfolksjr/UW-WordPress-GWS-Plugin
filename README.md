UW-WordPress-GWS-Plugin
=======================

Plugin to allow Shibboleth-authenticated WP instances to consume user groups in GWS.

Warning
------

This project is so experimental it's not even funny. I assume you:

* Either have or know how to get a shibboleth-enabled IDP
* Know what the UW Group Web Service is
* Are familiar with WordPress. Or even super familiar with WordPress.
* Like mucking around with configuration files on servers.
* Really like Apache
* Can troubleshoot like a superstar.
* Enjoy watching things break.
